# Le Baguette

Welcome to Le Baguette, a 27 Michelin star restaurant! This site allows you to keep track of the restaurant's menu, current ingredients, staff, and reservations.

When you are not an authorized user, you can still read most data, you are just unable to change or add new data.
Upon signing in through Google, you are now authorized to add/edit/delete the restauraunts staff, menu/ingredients, and reservations/seating.
To achieve this, the team utilized the CRUD method (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, & **D**elete) while connected to the Google Firebase API. You will notice the navigation buttons that take you to different dashboards. Within each dashboard, you can manipulate the data, and it will reflect in real-time within our Firebase Database and then update the DOM.

This project utilizes the DOM with Jquery as well as Axios Promises to retrieve and push data to Firebase.
